# EC601 Project Hairstyle Simulation

###### Team member: Lingxiu Ge, Lingshan Yang, Tong Ye, Yujia Wang

Haitstyle Simulation is a project which helps users who wish to see how they look with different hairstyles.

### Accomplishments
- Build an Android application that recognizes human face using Rajawali
- Rajawali is a 3D engine for Android based on OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0
- Use Rajawali's built-in function (Dlib) to recognize a human face and establish 68 (at most) key feature points
- Draw lines between certain feature points and use these lines to set up a 3D face model
- Connect  face feature with stickers coordinates
- Implemented simple stickers
- Implemented simple hairstyles


### How to run our app:
1. install andriod studio
2. import project
3. run project on an andriod phone (please note that our project DOES NOT work on virtual phone)
4. open main and choose a type of hair style
5. our app works the best when the user stays close to the front camera
6. Note that you may encounter "Invalid VCS root mapping" Errors but they are fine just ignore them.


### Recommendation
We are still working on getting more 3D hairstyle models to work for our project. For now, we only have two hairstyles that works well. We have implemented multiple colors for the hairstyles and created a recommendation module based on different hair colors. We have nine types of hairstyles and colors. If you click on the recommendation button, the recommended hairstyle based on our algorithm will show up. PLEASE note that you need to click on the recommendation button everytime the user is changed (a.k.a different faces).If the recommendation button is not clicked and user is changes, the app will keep showing the recommendation hairstyle for the previous user until the button is clicked.<br />
