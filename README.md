# EC601 Project Hairstyle Simulation

- Build an Android application that recognizes human face using Rajawali
- Rajawali is a 3D engine for Android based on OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0
- Use Rajawaliâ€™s built-in function (Dlib) to recognize a human face and establish 68 (at most) key feature points
- Draw lines between certain feature points and use these lines to set up a 3D face model
- Connect  face feature with stickers coordinates
- Implemented simple stickers
