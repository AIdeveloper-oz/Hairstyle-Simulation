# EC601 Project Hairstyle Simulation

Team member: Lingxiu Ge, Lingshan Yang, Tong Ye, Yujia Wang

- Build an Android application that recognizes human face using Rajawali
- Rajawali is a 3D engine for Android based on OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0
- Use Rajawaliâ€™s built-in function (Dlib) to recognize a human face and establish 68 (at most) key feature points
- Draw lines between certain feature points and use these lines to set up a 3D face model
- Connect  face feature with stickers coordinates
- Implemented simple stickers
- Implemented simple hairstyles


How to run our app:
1. install andriod studio
2. import project
3. run project on an andriod phone (please note that our project DOES NOT work on virtual phone)
4. open maim and choose a type of hair style
* our app works the best when the user stays close to the front camera
